                  <h3 class="heading">Early life</h3>
                  <p>Steve Jobs was born in San Francisco, 1955, to two university students Joanne Schieble and
                        Syrian-born
                        John Jandali. They were both unmarried at the time, and Steven was given up for adoption.
                        Steven was adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs, whom he always considered to be his real parents.
                        Steven’s
                        father, Paul, encouraged him to experiment with electronics in their garage. This led to a
                        lifelong
                        interest in electronics and design.<br>
                        Jobs attended a local school in California and later enrolled at Reed College, Portland, Oregon.
                        His
                        education was characterised by excellent test results and potential. But, he struggled with
                        formal
                        education and his teachers reported he was a handful to teach.
                        At Reed College, he attended a calligraphy course which fascinated him. He later said this
                        course was
                        instrumental in Apple’s multiple typefaces and proportionally spaced fonts.</p>
                  <h3 class="heading">Steve Jobs and Apple</h3>
                  <p>In 1976, Wozniak invented the first Apple I computer. Jobs, Wozniak and Ronald Wayne then set up
                        Apple
                        computers. In the very beginning, Apple computers were sold from Jobs parents’ garage.
                        Over the next few years, Apple computers expanded rapidly as the market for home computers began
                        to
                        become increasingly significant.
                        In 1984, Jobs designed the first Macintosh. It was the first commercially successful home
                        computer to
                        use a graphical user interface (based on Xerox Parc’s mouse driver interface.) This was an
                        important
                        milestone in home computing and the principle has become key in later home computers.<br>
                        Despite the many innovative successes of Jobs at Apple, there was increased friction between
                        Jobs and
                        other workers at Apple. In 1985, removed from his managerial duties, Jobs resigned and left
                        Apple. He
                        later looked back on this incident and said that getting fired from Apple was one of the best
                        things
                        that happened to him – it helped him regain a sense of innovation and freedom, he couldn’t find
                        work
                        in a large company.</p>
                  <h3 class="heading">Life After Apple</h3>
                  <p>On leaving Apple, Jobs founded NeXT computers. This was never particularly successful, failing to
                        gain
                        mass sales. However, in the 1990s, NeXT software was used as a framework in WebObjects used in
                        Apple
                        Store and iTunes store.<br> In 1996, Apple bought NeXT for $429 million.
                        Much more successful was Job’s foray into Pixar – a computer graphic film production company.
                        Disney
                        contracted Pixar to create films such as Toy Story, A Bug’s Life and Finding Nemo. These
                        animation
                        movies were highly successful and profitable – giving Jobs respect and success.<br>
                        In 1996, the purchase of NeXT brought Jobs back to Apple. He was given the post of chief
                        executive. At
                        the time, Apple had fallen way behind rivals such as Microsoft, and Apple was struggling to even
                        make
                        a profit.</p>

                  <h3 class="heading">Return to Apple</h3>
                  <p>Jobs launched Apple in a new direction. With a certain degree of ruthlessness, some projects were
                        summarily ended. Instead, Jobs promoted the development of a new wave of products which focused
                        on
                        accessibility, appealing design and innovate features.<br>
                        The iPod was a revolutionary product in that it built on existing portable music devices and set
                        the
                        standard for portable digital music. In 2008, iTunes became the second biggest music retailer in
                        the
                        US, with over six billion song downloads and over 200 million iPods sold.
                        In 2007, Apple successfully entered the mobile phone market, with the iPhone. This used features
                        of
                        the iPod to offer a multi-functional and touchscreen device to become one of the best-selling
                        electronic products.<br> In 2010, he introduced the iPad – a revolutionary new style of tablet
                        computers.
                        The design philosophy of Steve Jobs was to start with a fresh slate and imagine a new product
                        that
                        people would want to use. This contrasted with the alternative approach of trying to adapt
                        current
                        models to consumer feedback and focus groups. Job’s explains his philosophy of innovative
                        design.</p>
